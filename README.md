## Hello,

We are c0nnect. **c0nnect** helps you **organise** and **manage** **events** with your friends. This triggers c0nnect **users** to **actively** **participate** in social **activities**; the exact thing getting you off your phone.

It is almost impossible to arrange meetings with friends in our modern society. Take Whats-app for an example, one of the most popular social media platforms. You either send a message to a group chat which quickly gets buried in a pile of stickers and useless texts, or you have to be a hub trying to communicate with a dozen people at a time which no everyone is really willing to do. This goes for all social media apps.

Our Mission is to make a user experience as simple and intuitive for the user as possible. We broke down social media to its very core, leaving follower-counting, commenting, liking etc. completely behind., We want you to share moments with your friends, not random Individuals you barely know. That's why you also have to physically meet somebody to request a friendship.

We incur you to go out. But we can't do that with the help of your friends. That's why friends are able to challenge you to do specific task over the week. Who completed all task at highest , wins!
